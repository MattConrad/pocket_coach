# TODO List

## High Priority
- [ ] Reorganize task providers so task modifications are handled more elegantly
  - Current approach has TaskNotifier manually invalidating multiple separate FutureProviders
  - Consider single comprehensive TaskNotifier that manages all task state and operations
  - Other providers can derive from this main state rather than making independent DB calls
  - This would eliminate tight coupling and reduce boilerplate invalidation code
